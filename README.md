# RedvsBlue
Red vs Blue is a card game designed to teach cyber security concepts.

Red vs Blue functions by players taking on the roles of either the REd Team or Blue Team in a cyber attack scenario. Whilst the Blue Team purchases and builds up it's assets to develop it's cyber defences, the Red Team is purchasing hacking tools and assets to enable it to launch cyber-attacks against the Blue Team. Each turn the Red Team may choose to play an Attack Card. If the Blue Team doesn't have the necessary Asset Cards to mitigate the attack, then the Red Teams Attack is successful and the Blue Team suffers the impact of the damages described on the attack card. Should the Blue Team be able to repel the Attack it suffers no damages. 

As both the Red Teams cyber capabilities improve so does the level of sophistication and impact of it's attacks. Whilst as the Blue Teams cyber defences improve it opens open business opportunities and allows them to secure Contracts which provide them with more capital from which they can buy more assets. Building up their business and cyber defences to the point they are finally able to build themselves a nice shiny Security Operations Centre (SOC).

Red vs Blue has 2 game modes: Single and Two-Player

In Single Player mode, the Blue Team faces random Attacks each round whilst it attempts to build it's cyber defences and contracts.

In Two-Player mode, the Blue Team is pitted against a live adversary and must deal with the mechinations of the Red Team.

Red vs Blue is a great little game for teaching cyber security and business management skills, and can be easily modded for any level of technical understanding. Though originally designed for Key Stage 4/5 students in the UK, it is easily modded for Higher Education or the Corporate Sector.

Red vs Blue was developed for the University West of England, Cyber West Events.
